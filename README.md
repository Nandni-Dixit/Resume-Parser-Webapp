The Resume Parser WebApp is a full-stack application designed to automatically extract and structure key information from resumes. Built with a React frontend and a Flask backend, it allows users to upload resumes in formats like PDF and DOCX, and parses important details such as name, contact information, education, skills, and work experience.

Key features include:

File Upload: Users can upload resumes in multiple formats.

Data Extraction: Backend uses Python libraries to process and extract structured data.

Interactive UI: React-based frontend displays parsed information in a clean and readable format.

Backend API: Flask handles file processing and returns JSON responses to the frontend.

Scalable Architecture: Frontend can be deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway or Render, allowing seamless integration and live parsing functionality.

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, including frontend design, backend API development, and deployment of modern web applications, making it a practical tool for HR tech or recruitment automation.
